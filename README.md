# Astrolabe
3D navigation techniques Evaluation<

# Purpose
This code is used for a project driven learning exercice in schools of engineerings (Institut Mines Telecom Atlantique). Mixing skills and years, students have to understand and build an experimental protocol to compare performance of navigation techniques in 3D environments.

# installation
- import project into Eclipse (File / Import / Git / Projects from Git)
- add the lib/win32 directory to the system PATH

- install Android SDK to upload/develop the Android control app

# dependencies (already included in the project)

- for linux, install blueCove, pick a version with x64 build if you have a x64 operating system:
  http://snapshot.bluecove.org/distribution/download/2.1.1-SNAPSHOT/2.1.1-SNAPSHOT.62/

# runnning
- Mouse and Keyboard available
